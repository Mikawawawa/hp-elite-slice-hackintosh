The hackintosh EFI for hp elite slice

About the device: https://www.hp.com/sg-en/desktops/business/elite-slice.html

I'm not very sure about my device's generation, maybe G1 or G2, I bought it serveral years ago on from a second-hand computer shop online. So I can just list the core parts's information.

CPU : Intel Core i5-7500T
GPU : Intel HD630
WiFi : Intel AC8260

Works on Mac OS 12.6

## Basic
The device is hacked as mac mini 8, and the CPU is recogonalized correctly.

## USB Ports
I configured USB ports. All USB-A ports are available, but the full functional USB-C port doesn't support DP interface, I think HP doesn't aligned the port completely with USB-C priciple, as the port can get enough power supply by hp's own USB-C dock, but it doesn't work with other USB-C dock or wire from Display.

## Wireless
WIFI and Bluetooth works fine, the speed has no effective reduction, while the Airdrop is not available as expected.

## Storage
SSD works natively, I installed the system on a KIOXIA's SATA3 NGFF SSD and installed another Windows 11 system instance the M.2 port.

## Video and Audio
HDMI/DP works, HDMI support 4k30HZ and DP supports 4K60HZ, but the HiDPI doesn't work very well, I connected a LG UP850N display device, but the HiDPI's resolution set is a 2K's.

All Audio ports work fine, including the inside one
